## User Story
     AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
     I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
     SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



## Acceptance Criteria

- [x]    GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
        WHEN I load the portfolio
        THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
   

- [x]    WHEN I view the header
        THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio


- [x]    WHEN I view the navigation titles
        THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
   

- []    WHEN I click on a navigation title
        THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted


- []    WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
        THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
 

- []    WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
        THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them


- []    WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
        THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository


- []    WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
        THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message


- []    WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
        THEN I receive a notification that this field is required  

- []    WHEN I enter text into the email address field
        THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address


- []    WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
        THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
  

- []    WHEN I view the footer
        THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
